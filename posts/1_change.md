Explanation of change, and its possible scenarios.

You reading this implies that there is "CHANGE", being through you implies that "EXISTS" (in the form of thoughts/sensations), and being now implies that it is "PRESENT". The past and the future are chronological compositions within a mind (what we call time), but the present is the current state of everything that exists.

A [full circle](./imgs/change_full_circle.jpg) symbolizes ALL the present change. This change may or may not contain "awareness", that is, a part of it (organism) is aware of it (creates existance, simulation level 0). The [path](./imgs/change_path.jpg) within the full circle depicts a finite lifetime of an "organism", which determines the radius (hence the perimeter) of its associated full circle.

This "organism" might be able to learn the logical rules that govern local change, and use them to determine a part of it, i.e. technology.

With technology, it is possible to organize simulations (controlled change that contains organisms), each of these increase the simulation level (N+1) if they are nested.

Some questions:
What level of simulation are you at? 
Are any of your parent simulation levels determined?
